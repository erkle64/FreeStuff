Adds a creative chest for continuously spawning items.  Available in creative mode or the debug panel.

### Usage
- Find it next to the logistics containers in the creative menu.
- Can also be accessed from the debug panel.  Press shift+alt+O, to enable debug mode, then press O to open the panel.  I will likely be near the bottom of the list, or you can type `creative` in the search box.
- It works like an assembler but with all the recipes unlocked and requires no inputs.
